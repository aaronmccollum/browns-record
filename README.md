# Browns Season Record Program
This is my first program written in the Ruby language!  It takes an array of win/loss results and defines a method to iterate through the wins/loss array and print out a statement with the amount of wins and losses the Browns currently have (as of 10/23/2020).

Future ideas:
- Create a method that takes in two scores (Browns score and other team's score) and will add a "w" or a "l" to the win/loss array automatically
